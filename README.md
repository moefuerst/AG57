# AG57

This fork provides source files and additional information for studying the AG57 typeface design, a digitisation of G.G. Lange’s 1956-1957 reworking of the 14-48pt hand-setting weights of Akzidenz Grotesk.

Unfortunately, the upstream project was released under a restrictive license (probably in anticipation of later commercialisation). I therefore suspect that there will be little interest in investing community effort to expand the font family. For now, this repo is primarily intended to serve as educational resource, hopefully on the way towards a truly open AG some day.

Please note that the software provided is under CC-BY-NC-SA, so creating OFL-flavour open fonts is not permitted. If you use or build on these materials, please credit the original designers and respect the terms of the license.

## Notes on the Materials
- The source files were reverse-engineered from the binary files released by the upstream project, with all the limitations that entails.

## Contributing
I appreciate additional information, links to specimens, images of the original AG “Serie 57” in use, etc.
